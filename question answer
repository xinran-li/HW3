What code draws the blades of grass?
	line 10 to 11:
		stroke(random(60, 70), 100, 90);
       		line(x, height-10, x+random(-10, 10), height-10-random(h));

What code makes the "lawnmower" come by? How often does it come by?
	line 21 to 25
		  if (random(100) > 99.9) {
 		   fill(25);
		   rect(0, 0, width, height-10);
		    h = 10;
    		}
	as long as the the height of the grass is reaching at the y-axis randomly from 0 to 100, it will create a 	white rectangle to be “lawnmower”.

What's the point of the h variable?
	The height of the grass.

What does the -10 do in the second and fourth arguments of the line function, height-10-random(h) ? Why is it there?
	line 11 the height-10 means the surface of the mud, -random(h) means the height 	of the grass growing at the random height from 0 to 10.
